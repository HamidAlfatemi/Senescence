<p align="justify">The ultimate goal of my work, of which <strong>senescence.info</strong> is a part, is <a href="death_and_aging_fears.html">to cure aging</a>. In this website, I have two main objectives: 1) to highlight the importance of research on aging; 2) to offer an overview of current research on aging and longevity that is accessible to anyone with a basic understanding of science. As such, <strong>senescence.info</strong> is divided into two main sections. First, there is <a href="gerontology_tutorials.html">a section for visitors</a>, whose main goal is to put forth and demonstrate the importance of research on the basic biology of aging. Then there is a more technical section dealing with the <a href="gerontology.html">biology of aging</a>, which combines essays ranging from general observations and concepts in the field with more detailed discussions of theories and hypotheses of aging. In addition to these two sections, there is also a section regarding a more <a href="global_science.html">global view of research on aging</a> and its impact on society. I hope my website, started in 1997, can enlighten visitors from different backgrounds about this mysterious process called aging and why research on aging must be a top priority for society.</p>

<p align="justify">I have been studying aging for over 10 years and I am currently a principal investigator at the <a href="http://www.liv.ac.uk/">University of Liverpool</a> in the UK. You can find more information about me and my work in <a href="http://jp.senescence.info">my personal website</a> and in <a href="http://pcwww.liv.ac.uk/~aging/">my lab's website</a>, respectively.</p>

<p align="justify">Finally, please take a moment to read <strong>senescence.info</strong>'s <a href="disclaimer.html">disclaimer and conditions of use</a>. By accessing <strong>senescence.info</strong> it is assumed that you understand and agree with these conditions.</p>
